Currently in progress, it is a fully working menubar app that works cross platform to control your philips hue lights.

![Example](example.png?raw=true)

##Building

Until we package this up for release, running the app by doing:

- `npm install electron-prebuilt -g`
- `npm install`
- change your ip address in hue.js
- [create a user name](http://www.developers.meethue.com/documentation/getting-started) called `apideveloper` on your bridge
- `electron .`
